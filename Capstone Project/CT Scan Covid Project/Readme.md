# I have completed this project with these steps

### 1- [Download the Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WOeodRmv1Mw5Cswuip3nUIi6ViQWKpo_?usp=sharing)
### 2- The images are in different sizes so I have to take a fixed size on which I have to work.
### 3- Do Data Augmentation on it, mention at least 5 arguments insidie it.
### 4- Train Model on it you only have to use ResNet from ResNet you can pick any layer model like: ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, ResNet-110, ResNet-152, ResNet-164, ResNet-1202. Mention early stopping and Model check point while training.
### 5- Do Prediction and mention multitple preformance metrics.
